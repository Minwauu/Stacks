## Stacks

A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always take place at the same end. The end is commonly referred to as the **top** or **top of stack**. The end opposite the top is known as the **base** or **stack base**.

Items can only be taken off a stack at the top. This is known as **popping** and the operation is called **pop**. Items can only be added to a stack at the stop. This is known as **pushing**.
